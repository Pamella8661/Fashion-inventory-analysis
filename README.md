## üí° Insights & Recommendations

| Insight | Action |
|--------|--------|
| High discounts don‚Äôt lead to higher stockouts | Focus on popular brands and better demand planning, not just price cuts |
| Most products fall under low-margin due to frequent discounting | Review pricing strategy and supplier deals to protect margins |
| ‚ÄúStraight Kurta‚Äù is the most overstocked product | Monitor performance vs. stock levels to avoid oversupply |
| August shows peak deliveries. | Stock up ahead of known seasonal peaks to meet demand |

## ‚úçÔ∏è Lessons Learned / Reflections  

Cleaning and enriching data (like creating discount percentages and margin segments) adds powerful insight with simple math.  
- EDA gives direction: It helps you understand what matters before building a dashboard.  
- Simple charts tell big stories: Pie charts, bar charts, and KPI cards, when well-labeled, are enough to communicate trends to stakeholders.  
- Documenting the process forces clarity; it helps you spot gaps and explain your value to others.
